# IBM Watson Discovery Service IndexWriter plugin for Apache Nutch

Windows
-------
If you are running on Windows, please follow the README [here](https://gist.github.com/arunsure/14e497339ee81aff70356c05ce260eaa)

Requirements
------------

* Java (OpenJDK 8/Oracle JDK)
(HBase, Zookeeper, Nutch, Ant, and Gradle are also required, but will be installed for you when you set up the Gradle wrapper.)

* Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable 

  On *MAC OS*, JAVA_HOME can be found at (or in a similar location): `/Library/Java/Home/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_66.jdk/Contents/Home`

  On *LINUX*, JAVA_HOME can be found at (or in a similar location): `/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64`

Set up Gradle wrapper
----------------
```bash
./gradlew
```

Setting up HBase
----------------

You can now use the built-in gradle task to setup Hbase.

```bash
./gradlew setupHbase
```

* This will create directories within the project directory to store Hbase and Zookeeper data.
* Downloads hbase-0.98.8-hadoop2 in build directory.

Now, startup hbase service by going into the hbase directory: _projectDir_/build/hbase-0.98.8-hadoop2/bin/
and run:

```bash
./start-hbase.sh
```

Setting up Nutch
----------------

Download and extract apache-nutch-2.3.1 in the build directory:

```bash
./gradlew setupNutch
```

Then edit `conf/nutch-discovery/nutch-site.xml` with Discovery credentials. The values for the first three properties (endpoint, username, and password) are provided by the Discovery service. The others are provided by your specific instance of the Discovery service.

```xml
  <property>
    <name>discovery.endpoint</name>
    <value></value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>discovery.username</name>
    <value></value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>discovery.password</name>
    <value></value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>discovery.configuration.id</name>
    <value></value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>discovery.environment.id</name>
    <value></value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>discovery.api.version</name>
    <value></value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>discovery.collection.id</name>
    <value></value>
  </property>
```

To build the plugin, run:

```bash
./gradlew buildPlugin
```

This will take about 4-5 minutes to complete; please be patient. 
That's it. Everything is now set up to crawl websites.

Adding new Domains to crawl with Nutch
--------------------------------------

1. Edit the text file `seed/urls.txt` to specify a list of seed URLs.

  ```bash
  $ mkdir seed
  $ echo "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Nutch" >> $projectDir/seed/urls.txt
  ```

Crawl and Index
----------------

```bash
$projectDir/crawl
```

Note: On the first run, this will only crawl the injected URLs. The procedure above is supposed to be repeated regularly to keep the index up to date.
